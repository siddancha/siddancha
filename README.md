### Hi there 👋 👨‍💻

I'm Sid, a PhD student in the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I work on _Robot Perception_: enabling robots to sense and understand complex environments. I draw on techniques at the intersection of machine learning, robotics, computer vision and computational imaging.

Currently, I am developing perception algorithms for an exciting new controllable sensor called [Programmable Light Curtains](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ILIM/light_curtains/), towards accurate, efficient and reliable robot perception.
