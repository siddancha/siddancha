### Hi there 👋 👨‍💻

I'm Sid, a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://web.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT</a> in <a href="https://aeroastro.mit.edu/people/nicholas-roy/">Nicholas Roy</a>'s <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/">Robust Robotics Group</a>. I work at the intersection of robot perception and planning towards enabling robots to autonomously and reliably perceive and act in complex environments.

Previosuly, I was a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.ml.cmu.edu/">Machine Learning Department</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">CMU</a>, where I developed active sensing algorithms for an exciting new controllable sensor called [Programmable Light Curtains](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ILIM/light_curtains/), drawing on techniques at the intersection of computer vision, planning, machine learning and robotics.
