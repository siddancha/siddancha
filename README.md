### Hi there 👋 👨‍💻

I'm Sid, a research scientist at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) working on robot learning. My current research interests are in **diffusion/flow-matching policies for robotic manipulation** and **vision-language-action (VLA) models**. Previously, I was a postdoc at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) working with [Nicholas Roy](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/people/nicholas-roy/), [Leslie Kaelbling](https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/) and [Tomás Lozano-Pérez](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tlp/).

Previosuly, I was a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.ml.cmu.edu/">Machine Learning Department</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">CMU</a>,  co-advised by [David Held](https://davheld.github.io/) and [Srinivasa Narasimhan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~srinivas/). My PhD work developed active perception algorithms for [Programmable Light Curtains](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ILIM/light_curtains/), a fast and high-resolution depth sensor that needs to be controlled intelligently in order to sense efficiently.
